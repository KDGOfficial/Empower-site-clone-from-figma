paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.

# We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and
keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.

than the employer's scheduled payment date.

transaction posts, which may be up to a week after the qualifying purchase
